# Finite-State-Machine-Ant-Brain

This is a project to learn and explore Finite State Machines through the [State Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern). Managing complex state is challenging but it can be made easier by using state machines to manage states and transitions.

This example models ant behaviour as described in [this article](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/finite-state-machines-theory-and-implementation--gamedev-11867).
